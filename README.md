# Node Farm

This project is a basic example of a Node.js HTTP server. It imports necessary modules like `fs`, `http`,
`url`, and `slugify`, reads HTML and JSON files, creates an HTTP server, handles different routes, and listens on port 8000. It serves static and dynamic content based on the requested URL path, including product overviews, individual product pages, and an API endpoint.
